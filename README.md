Dealan is an advanced HTML5 opensource gesture-based sound board made to break free.

The Story So Far
================

Is someone you know still using a 0.99$ *waggle-to-whip* app for whipping you with his smartphone in +2013? **For real?**

Fear not, **Dealan** is an advanced HTML5 opensource gesture-based sound board made for you to break free! Just check the project out, host it somewhere or save it locally on your smartphone and **fight back for freedom for free!**

Features
========

- **Whip**: shake your mobile to whip back to the taskmaster!
- **Gun**: want to fight back *a-la Indiana Jones*? Just tap the screen and fire!
- **Shotgun**: your taskmaster is a *big boss*? Use your *Doom skills*, shake the device to reload and tap to fire!
- **Shuriken**: WiiU fan? So am I. Swipe the finger on the screen and throw shuriken like in *Nintendoland*!
- **Knife**: not WiiU fan? Everybody can be wrong. Just throw'em a knife shaking your mobile!
- **Motorcycle**: need a quick escape? Pick your mobile like a motorcycle throttle and give full gas!
- **Drill**: when you need to be convincing, you can be inspired by classics. Classics horror, for example. A drill, in this case, is always useful.

Non-Features
============

- Okay. AUDIO tags in HTML5 are still implemented like a$$. Some kind of delay before a sample starts on some mobile/browser combination.
- GUI can be better. Make it better. :)
- Just seven modes? Tsk.
- You need to lock your device orientation to portrait manually. Fix it with some hit of *PhoneGap* and similiar. And commit, thanks!

Tested On
=========

- Android, Chrome, Smartphone
- iOS 5.1.1, Safari, iPad v1 *(just a huge whip)*
- iOS 7, Safari, iPhone 4

It should work somewhere else. Just try!

I Don't Want To Check This Out
==============================

You can try a version placed somewhere in time at [kesiev.com](http://www.kesiev.com/dealan). I'll try to keep that version up-to-date.

Why Dealan?
===========

The name **Dealan** comes from the scottish-gaelic word *dealan-d√®*, which means "butterfly". Just *fly away free*. Some poetry here. And some wikipedia [here](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dealan-d%C3%A9). Don't trust any other interpretation.
